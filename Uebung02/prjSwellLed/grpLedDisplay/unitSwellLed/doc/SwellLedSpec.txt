Function
********
The user has two keys at hand to influence the brightness of an LED. 
One of the keys will dimm the LED and is named DimmKey the other will
brighten the LED and is named BrightenKey. 

Pressing one of these keys will continually dimm or brighten the LED
as long as the key is being pressed. The speed with which dimming
or brightening occurs shall be reasonable.

The oLed is the LED whose bightness can be influenced with the
keys. The LED shall not flicker, but glow steadily  measured by the
perception capabilities of the human eye.

The most dimmed state of the oLed is Dark. The most brightened state
is FullBright. Pressing the DimmKey when the state of the LED is Dark 
will not change the state. The same with the BrightenKey and the state
FullBright.

Pressing no key will not alter the state of the LED. The behaviour
resulting from pressing both keys at the same time is the same as
pressing one key arbitrarily or pressing no key.

Reset
*****
The key named R will be used to give an reset to the application. The
reset state of the oLed (its brightness after a reset) can be any
state depending on ease of design.

Clock 
*****
A 50MHz oscillator shall be used to provide the clock for the system.
